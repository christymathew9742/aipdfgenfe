==📄 PDF Chat Integration with Gemini AI==

This project integrates PDF upload, text extraction, and AI-based training using the Gemini API to create a dynamic chat experience based on PDF content.

==🧠 Overview==
This system allows users to:

Upload PDFs using UploadCare

Extract text from those PDFs using PDF.co

Format extracted text into training data compatible with Gemini AI

Enable a conversational chat interface based on the trained data


==⚙️ Working Procedure==

✅ Step 1: Upload PDF using UploadCare
We use UploadCare to handle the file upload process and obtain a secure CDN URL for the uploaded PDF.

🔧 Implementation:
Add UploadCare widget to your frontend.

Set your public API key.

Upon successful upload, you’ll receive a file URL (CDN link).

✅ Step 2: Extract Text using PDF.co
Once you have the PDF URL from UploadCare, use PDF.co to extract text from the file.

🔧 API Request:
Use a POST request to https://api.pdf.co/v1/pdf/convert/to/text.

This returns the raw text extracted from the PDF.

✅ Step 3: Format Text as Gemini Training Data
Parse the extracted text and manually or programmatically convert it into a Gemini AI-compatible format.

🔧 Training Data Structure:
[
  {
    "input": "What is the document about?",
    "output": "This PDF contains details about..."
  },
  {
    "input": "List the key highlights.",
    "output": "1. Feature A\n2. Feature B\n..."
  }
]
You can prepare multiple Q&A pairs from the extracted content for better accuracy.


✅ Step 4: Train & Integrate with Gemini AI
Use Google’s Gemini AI Studio or Gemini API to load your training data.

Options:
Upload training data manually via Gemini Studio

Use API for real-time integration with your app
